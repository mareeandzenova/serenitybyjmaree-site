      <h1>Private Emotional Integration</h1>
      <p><em>A quiet, private container for emotional clarity, nervous system settling, and feeling like yourself again.</em></p>

      <p>
        This is a short-term, private space for people who feel tired of carrying something unnamed, foggy or emotionally disconnected,
        stuck in their head, overwhelmed by internal noise, or simply ready for things to feel softer.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t need fixing. You don’t need advice. You don’t need motivation.
        You may just need space where nothing is rushed — and where someone can sit with you, without judgment,
        until what’s been heavy feels lighter.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Space Feels Like</h2>

      <p>
        People often describe this container as quiet, steady, grounding, warm, gentle, clarifying, and settling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like an intimate conversation by a fireplace.
        Like being in a candle-lit room.
        Like finally being able to exhale.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no pressure to perform.
        No pressure to heal.
        No pressure to change.
        No pressure to know what you need before you arrive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just space — held carefully, calmly, and without judgment.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Work Actually Is</h2>

      <p>
        This is not therapy. Not coaching. Not advice-giving. Not trauma processing. Not mindset work.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s structured emotional reflection and nervous-system-safe integration.
      </p>

      <p>
        That means: I listen closely. I reflect what I hear. I help you put language to what you’re carrying.
        I help your system settle. I help you feel coherent again — internally first.
      </p>

      <p>
        There’s no homework. No fixing. No digging for trauma. No emotional pushing.
        Just guided space for what’s already here to complete naturally.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

      <p>This container is especially supportive if you’re navigating:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Life transitions</li>
        <li>Burnout</li>
        <li>Grief</li>
        <li>Identity shifts</li>
        <li>Emotional numbness</li>
        <li>Decision fatigue</li>
        <li>Loss of self-trust</li>
        <li>Feeling “off” without knowing why</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Especially if:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You’ve already done therapy or coaching</li>
        <li>You’re emotionally aware but still feel unresolved</li>
        <li>You’re tired of trying to “figure yourself out”</li>
        <li>You want relief without analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You don’t need to know what’s wrong.
        You don’t need the right words.
        You don’t need a goal.
      </p>

      <p>
        You just need space.

      <h2>What Changes When Things Settle</h2>

      <p>People often leave with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A quieter mind</li>
        <li>A softer nervous system</li>
        <li>Clearer internal boundaries</li>
        <li>Less emotional urgency</li>
        <li>A felt sense of grounding</li>
        <li>More trust in themselves</li>
        <li>Decisions that feel simpler</li>
        <li>Language for what they’ve been carrying</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Not because anything was fixed — but because something finally finished.

      <h2>How the Container Works</h2>

      <p>
        This is a short-term, private, high-touch container designed for emotional clarity and internal coherence.
      </p>

      <h3>What You Receive</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Two private sessions</strong><br />
          Session 1 — 75 minutes<br />
          Session 2 — 60 minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personalized session summaries</strong><br />
          Written reflections after each session so nothing feels lost or abstract.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Two private integration reflections (audio)</strong><br />
          Gentle, personalized voice notes designed to support emotional settling between sessions — not as “work,” but as nervous-system care.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This container typically unfolds over 3–4 weeks.
      </p>
