    <h1>Private<br>Emotional<br>Integration</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      A private, four-week emotional reset — like a retreat you don’t have to leave your life for.
      Structured emotional clarity + narrative coherence + nervous-system-safe reflection that helps
      people understand what they’re in and what comes next — internally first, externally second.
    </p>

    <p>
      This container is for people who feel stuck, foggy, or disconnected from themselves —
      especially during life transitions, burnout, grief, or identity shifts.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        This is not therapy, coaching, or advice-giving. Instead, it is structured emotional reflection
        and narrative integration designed to help you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand what you’re actually feeling</li>
        <li>Name internal tensions and patterns</li>
        <li>See your experiences in a coherent story</li>
        <li>Strengthen self-trust and clarity</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>What’s Included</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Two private sessions (voice or video)</li>
      <li>Two personalized asynchronous reflections (voice or written)</li>
      <li>Gentle integration prompts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The focus isn’t fixing you — it’s helping you feel more yourself, more coherent, and more grounded
      in your own knowing.
    </p>

    <p class="soft-note">
      If you’re looking for advice, motivation, productivity hacks, or therapy, this container is not for you.
      But if you want emotional clarity, grounding, and internal resolution, it may be a fit.
    </p>

    <h2>What Success Looks Like</h2>
    <p>Clients typically leave with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Language for what they’re actually feeling</li>
      <li>Internal contradictions that feel understandable instead of chaotic</li>
      <li>Increased self-trust and emotional grounding</li>
      <li>A felt sense of clarity — not a prescribed plan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>How is this different from therapy?</strong>
        <p>
          Therapists diagnose, treat, and work clinically with mental health conditions.
          This container is non-clinical, non-diagnostic, and focused on reflection and narrative integration.
          You leave with clarity and coherence, not a treatment plan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>How is this different from coaching?</strong>
        <p>
          Coaches focus on outcomes, accountability, and goals.
          You focus on internal clarity, understanding your experience, and self-trust.
          There are no performance metrics, no assignments, and no “next steps” other than what you choose internally.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>How is this different from talking to a friend?</strong>
        <p>
          Friends offer emotional reciprocity, advice, and casual support — often inconsistently.
          This container is fully dedicated, structured, and intentionally reflective.
          You receive space, language, and integration designed to clarify your inner world — safely, reliably, and privately.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>How is this different from AI?</strong>
        <p>
          AI can generate responses and insight, but it cannot hold presence, regulate a human nervous system,
          or feel the nuance of your experience. Human relational attunement, emotional mirroring,
          and nervous-system-safe guidance are biologically and experientially irreplaceable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Is this like paying to talk to someone?</strong>
        <p>
          The value is not in conversation alone. It’s in structured, intentional, professionalized reflection.
          You’re paying for someone who can hold space, reflect your inner reality, integrate it into language,
          and provide clarity — without judgment, distraction, or emotional labor on your part.
