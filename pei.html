      <h1>Private Emotional Integration (PEI)</h1>
      <p><h2>A private, four-week emotional clarity container—</h2> like a retreat you don’t have to leave your life for. <br>Private Emotional Integration is a structured, high-touch container designed to help you understand what you’re actually in — emotionally, internally, and narratively — so you can move forward with clarity instead of confusion.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Hook -->
    <section class="section highlight">
      <p>This isn’t therapy, coaching, or advice-giving.<br>
It’s <strong>guided emotional reflection and narrative integration</strong> — held in a nervous-system-safe, non-pathologizing way — that helps you make sense of what’s happening inside you before trying to change anything outside you.</p>
      <p>It’s for people who feel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stuck, foggy, or internally fragmented</li>
        <li>In the middle of a life transition, burnout, grief, or identity shift</li>
        <li>Disconnected from their own emotional clarity or self-trust</li>
        <li>Tired of thinking about their life but not actually <em>understanding</em> it</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What This Container Actually Does</h2>
      <p>Instead of fixing, motivating, or prescribing, this container helps you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand what you’re actually feeling — not what you think you should feel</li>
        <li>Name internal tensions without collapsing into them</li>
        <li>See your experiences as a coherent story instead of disconnected events</li>
        <li>Strengthen self-trust by clarifying your own internal reality</li>
        <li>Feel emotionally grounded instead of internally scattered</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The outcome is not a plan.<br>
        It’s<strong>coherence</strong>— emotional, narrative, and internal.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What You Receive</h2> 
      <p>This is a fully private, time-bound container designed as a complete emotional arc — not ongoing support, not an open-ended relationship.</p>
      <h3>1. Two Private Live Sessions</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>(75 minutes + 60 minutes | voice or video)</p>
        <p>These are deep, spacious sessions where we explore what’s actually present beneath surface narratives. You’re not coached, analyzed, or advised — you’re reflected, witnessed, and helped translate your internal experience into language that makes sense.</p>

<p>Outcome:</p>
        <br>You leave each session with emotional clarity instead of emotional fog.
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2. Personalized Post-Session Summaries</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>After each live session, you receive a carefully written summary that captures:</p>
        <li>What emerged emotionally</li>
        <li>The core tensions or patterns named</li>
        <li>The internal shifts that occurred</li>
        <li>Language you can return to later</li>
        <p>These are not transcripts — they are <strong>integration documents</strong> that help insights stick instead of dissolving after conversation.</p>

<p>Outcome:</p>
        <br>You gain a coherent internal map, not just a memory of a conversation.
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Two Private Integration Reflections</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>Between sessions, you receive two personalized voice reflections designed specifically for you — based on what surfaced in your sessions.</p>
        <p>These are not generic meditations or prompts.</p>
        <p>They are <strong>custom emotional integration</strong> pieces that help your nervous system settle, your insights land, and your internal shifts stabilize.</p>

<p>Outcome:</p>
        <br>Transformation continues between sessions — without homework, effort, or performance.
      </ul>
      
      <p><em>No homework. No fixing. No pressure. Just guided space to let what’s already here settle and integrate.</em></p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q1: How is this different from therapy?</h3>
        <p>Therapists diagnose, treat, and work clinically with mental health conditions. This container is non-clinical, non-diagnostic, and focused on reflection and narrative integration. You leave with clarity and coherence, not a treatment plan.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q2: How is this different from coaching?</h3>
        <p>Coaches focus on outcomes, accountability, and goals. You focus on <strong>internal clarity, understanding your experience, and self-trust</strong>. There are no performance metrics, no assignments, and no “next steps” other than what you choose internally.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q3: How is this different from talking to a friend?</h3>
        <p>Friends offer emotional reciprocity, advice, and casual support — often inconsistently. This container is <strong>fully dedicated, structured, and intentionally reflective</strong>. You receive space, language, and integration designed to clarify your inner world — safely, reliably, and privately.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q4: How is this different from AI?</h3>
        <p>AI can generate responses and insight, but it cannot <strong>hold presence, regulate a human nervous system, or feel the nuance of your experience</strong>. Human relational attunement, emotional mirroring, and nervous-system-safe guidance are biologically and experientially irreplaceable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q5: Is this like paying to talk to someone?</h3>
        <p>The value is not in conversation alone. It’s in <strong>structured, intentional, professionalized reflection</strong>. You’re paying for someone who can hold space, reflect your inner reality, integrate it into language, and provide clarity — without judgment, distraction, or emotional labor on your part.</p>
