      <h1>Private Emotional Integration (PEI) Container</h1>
      <p>A private, four-week emotional reset — like a retreat you don’t have to leave your life for. Structured emotional clarity + narrative coherence + nervous-system-safe reflection designed to help you understand what you’re in and what comes next — <strong>internally first, externally second</strong>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Hook -->
    <section class="section highlight">
      <p>No matter what you do, the same emotional loops keep returning. Nothing ever seems to fully settle. You’ve tried guides, books, coaches, and practices — yet the patterns persist.</p>
      <p>This container exists for that space: where you can explore what’s happening inside you, <strong>clearly and safely, without forcing or fixing anything</strong>.</p>
      <p>It’s for people who feel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stuck, foggy, or disconnected from themselves</li>
        <li>Burned out, grieving, or in transition</li>
        <li>Unsure of their identity or next steps</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>This is not therapy, coaching, or advice-giving</h2>
      <p>Instead, it is <strong>structured emotional reflection and narrative integration</strong>, designed to help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand what you’re actually feeling</li>
        <li>Name internal tensions and patterns</li>
        <li>See your experiences as a coherent story</li>
        <li>Strengthen self-trust and clarity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re looking for advice, motivation, productivity hacks, or therapy, this container is not for you. But if you want <strong>emotional clarity, grounding, and internal resolution</strong>, it may be a fit.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q1: How is this different from therapy?</h3>
        <p>Therapists diagnose, treat, and work clinically with mental health conditions. This container is non-clinical, non-diagnostic, and focused on reflection and narrative integration. You leave with clarity and coherence, not a treatment plan.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q2: How is this different from coaching?</h3>
        <p>Coaches focus on outcomes, accountability, and goals. You focus on <strong>internal clarity, understanding your experience, and self-trust</strong>. There are no performance metrics, no assignments, and no “next steps” other than what you choose internally.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q3: How is this different from talking to a friend?</h3>
        <p>Friends offer emotional reciprocity, advice, and casual support — often inconsistently. This container is <strong>fully dedicated, structured, and intentionally reflective</strong>. You receive space, language, and integration designed to clarify your inner world — safely, reliably, and privately.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q4: How is this different from AI?</h3>
        <p>AI can generate responses and insight, but it cannot <strong>hold presence, regulate a human nervous system, or feel the nuance of your experience</strong>. Human relational attunement, emotional mirroring, and nervous-system-safe guidance are biologically and experientially irreplaceable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Q5: Is this like paying to talk to someone?</h3>
        <p>The value is not in conversation alone. It’s in <strong>structured, intentional, professionalized reflection</strong>. You’re paying for someone who can hold space, reflect your inner reality, integrate it into language, and provide clarity — without judgment, distraction, or emotional labor on your part.</p>
