    <h1>Serenity by J. Maree</h1>
    <h2>Find Space. Feel Seen. Restore Yourself.</h2>
    <p>Serenity is a collection of <strong>personalized experiences designed to restore balance, curiosity, and emotional clarity</strong>. Each offering meets you exactly where you are, helping you navigate <strong>life’s transitions, grief, or creative blocks</strong>—without judgment, without pressure, without needing to “fix” anything.</p>
    <p>From <strong>guided voice rituals</strong> you can listen to in moments of overwhelm, to <strong>month-long immersive containers</strong> that help you realign with yourself, Serenity is here to help you <strong>settle into your own clarity and strength</strong>.</p>

    <h3>How Serenity Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Guided Voice Rituals</strong> – Short, intimate recordings crafted for reflection, emotional regulation, and self-compassion.</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly Rituals & Containers</strong> – Multi-week experiences that blend somatics, storytelling, and sensory guidance to help you integrate and release what’s holding you back.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalized Support</strong> – Every offering is bespoke, meeting your life where it is now.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Serenity isn’t therapy, coaching, or advice-giving. It’s the <strong>space to feel yourself again</strong>, in the midst of uncertainty, grief, or creative limbo.</blockquote>

    <h3>Step Deeper: Private Emotional Integration (PEI)</h3>
    <p>When you’re ready for <strong>a more intimate, private container</strong>, <strong>Private Emotional Integration (PEI)</strong> offers a <strong>short-term, one-on-one experience designed to help you settle, integrate, and realign your emotional landscape</strong>.</p>
